Welcome to Scorpiosec, a place where a love of technology and a passion for self-directed learning come together. I'm an aspiring security professional and I have been studying cybersecurity since 2022. I decided to switch to the tech field after my Bachelor of Finance (I wasn't feeling those spreadsheets). My goal is to get into red teaming or cloud security.

I created this blog because I wanted to showcase my skills and knowledge, it's also a journal for my tech adventure. Here, you will find my insights, hands-on projects, writeups, book reviews, tool guides etc... I'm always trying to learn new things.

Thanks for checking my blog and I hope you will find some useful information here! If you want to stay in touch, don't hesitate to connect with me on social media (links at the bottom of the page).

Certifications I currently hold: CCNA, CEH

Interests: Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, Machine Learning
