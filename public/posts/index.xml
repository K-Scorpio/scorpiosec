During our investigation of vulnerabilities in the software, we identify one that allows attackers to bypass authentication. Leveraging this exploit, we gain our initial foothold. Next, we stumble upon a directory for Apache Derby that containing numerous .dat files. Our task is to sift through these files. Using some command-line magic, we manage to retrieve a password hash.</description></item><item><title>HTB: Monitored</title><link>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/htb-monitored/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 21:41:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/htb-monitored/</guid><description>Platform: Hack The Box Link: Monitored Level: Medium OS: Linux Monitored emphasizes rigorous enumeration, the challenge starts with a login form for Nagios XI and directory enumeration leads to the discovery of more and more endpoints. After exhausting all the leads from our nmap TCP scan we make use of a UDP scan to find an exploitable service leading to the leakage of credentials that we use to login. We are able to discover the software version on the target and we leverage CVE-2023-40931 to add a new admin account to the Nagios XI instance to grant us access.</description></item><item><title>HTB: Surveillance</title><link>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/htb-surveillance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2024 15:48:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/htb-surveillance/</guid><description>Platform: Hack The Box Link: Surveillance Level: Medium OS: Linux Surveillance begins with the discovery of a web application running on port 80, after identifying the software version, we use CVE-2023-41892 to gain initial access. Through further exploration, we find a database backup leaking the user name and password hash for an admin user, which we utilize to SSH into the system and uncover an internal service. Leveraging SSH tunneling, we access the service and make use of CVE-2023-26035 to exploit it.</description></item><item><title>THM: Creative</title><link>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/thm-creative/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 22:14:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/thm-creative/</guid><description>Platform: TryHackMe Link: Creative Level: Easy OS: Linux The challenge begins with a static website that is unexploitable. Through subdomain enumeration, a URL testing application is uncovered, susceptible to SSRF. However, full exploitation is only possible after discovering an internally exposed port. This access allows for file reading on the server, leading to the retrieval of an SSH private key. Yet, this alone isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to establish a foothold. Success is achieved by cracking the obtained SSH key&amp;rsquo;s hash, granting access to the target system.</description></item><item><title>THM: Clocky</title><link>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/thm-clocky/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 13:03:18 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/thm-clocky/</guid><description>Platform: TryHackMe Link: Clocky Level: Medium OS: Linux For this challenge our objective is to locate six flags. Our inital step involves examining the robots.txt file which contains some file extensions. By fuzzing with those file extensions we obtain an archive and extracting it yields the source code of an application. Upon reviewing the code we identify a way to manipulate the application&amp;rsquo;s password reset mechanism, granting us access to the administrative dashboard.</description></item><item><title>HTB: Codify</title><link>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/htb-codify/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 16:50:10 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/htb-codify/</guid><description>Platform: Hack The Box Link: Codify Level: Easy OS: Linux Codify starts with a web application that offers a sandbox environment for testing Node.js code. It utilizes the vm2 library and employs a module whitelist for security. However, there is a vulnerability (CVE-2023-3214 ) in vm2 that can be exploited to break out of the sandbox and access the target system. This is followed by lateral movement to access another user account and obtain the user flag.</description></item><item><title>HTB: Analytics</title><link>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/htb-analytics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 01:25:21 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/htb-analytics/</guid><description>Platform: Hack The Box Link: Analytics Level: Easy OS: Linux Analytics features a Metabase instance, which is an open-source business intelligence software. The target is vulnerable to CVE-2023-38646 allowing command execution while unauthenticated. After enumerating the environment varialbles, SSH credentials are discovered and the root shell is gained via a kernel exploit.
