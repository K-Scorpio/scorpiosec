This access is then leveraged to exploit a directory traversal vulnerability, allowing arbitrary file reads and the disclosure of sensitive application data, including SSH credentials. After gaining an initial foothold, privilege escalation is achieved by abusing a misconfigured Terraform execution as root, ultimately leading to the recovery of the root SSH key.</description></item></channel></rss>
