After collecting an email list, we use cewl to create a customized password list. Hydra, successfully recovers the password for one of the email accounts. With swaks, we send a phishing email that results in a reverse shell on the target system. From there, we retrieve the password for a user account as well as the admin password for hMailServer.</description></item><item><title>THM: Smol</title><link>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/thm-smol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 11:31:43 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/thm-smol/</guid><description>Platform: TryHackMe Link: Smol Level: Medium OS: Linux Smol focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins. The challenge begins with enumerating a WordPress site using WPScan, where we discover a plugin vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). This allows us to extract credentials and log into the WordPress dashboard. Within the dashboard, a private note directs us to the source code of the Hello Dolly plugin, which contains a backdoor.</description></item></channel></rss>
