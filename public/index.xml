I&amp;rsquo;m an aspiring security professional and I have been studying cybersecurity since 2022. I decided to switch to the tech field after my Bachelor of Finance (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling those spreadsheets). My goal is to get into red teaming or cloud security.
I created this blog because I wanted to showcase my skills and knowledge, it&amp;rsquo;s also a journal for my tech adventure.</description></item></channel></rss>
