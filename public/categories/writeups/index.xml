Trickster is a multi-step machine beginning with the discovery of a subdomain containing a hidden .git directory, running an exploitable version of PrestaShop. Gaining initial access (with CVE-2024-34716) leads to the retrieval of database credentials from a configuration file, which help us find a user password.

Smol focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins. The challenge begins with enumerating a WordPress site using WPScan, where we discover a plugin vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). This allows us to extract credentials and log into the WordPress dashboard. Within the dashboard, a private note directs us to the source code of the Hello Dolly plugin, which contains a backdoor.</description></item><item><title>HTB: MonitorsThree</title><link>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/htb-monitorsthree/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 10:06:34 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://scorpiosec.com/posts/htb-monitorsthree/</guid><description>Platform: Hack The Box Link: MonitorsThree Level: Medium OS: Linux Read this write up in french
MonitorsThree begins with a website on port 80 and a Cacti instance hosted on a subdomain. The Forgot Password? feature on the main site is vulnerable to SQL injection, which we exploit to retrieve the admin user&amp;rsquo;s password. Using these credentials, we access the Cacti dashboard and leverage CVE-2024-25641 to gain an initial foothold on the system.</description></item></channel></rss>
